# Developer Notes

The way I built the project is a bit overkill for the final product (which added to the time), but I wanted to focus on scalability, modularity and the overall organization of the build. My goal, which I hoped I achieved, was to make sure that a different developer could quickly look at my project and know how to make changes to the styles. I added the theme kit to better visualize the changes made to the default bootstrap styles and I added the spacer variables to help keep everything uniform as the project becomes more complex. I also split up the styles into partials that I thought would make it easy to find where to make changes. In total it took me about 3 hours to finish (not counting YouTube to refresh my memory).  Unfortunately, I did not get to implement validation checks for the form, I was concerned with the amount of time I took in turning the project in (spent a lot of time at the vet this week, patient’s picture is featured in project). Final notes I installed sass via npm and used the postcss cli. Thank you for the opportunity to take this assessment, I hope I am the kind of developer you are looking for and I can move on to the next stage. 

# eSalon - Front End HTML/SASS Developer Evaluation
## Requirements
Make a page using the provided Figma design that allows the user to input their puppy’s profile information. On submit, the displayed information will show on a readonly page.
● Note that the input background color changes color on focus
● Month, Day, and Year are numeric inputs
● Error validation is optional. If you have time and/or you wish to have some extra fun, go
for it.
Guidelines
● Please put your code in a public Github repository for us to look at.
● Use SASS to build the CSS
● Use Bootstrap for your UI framework as much as possible
● Please explain any decisions you make, and the rationale behind them, in comments
throughout the code. Think of these as presentation notes you might make, if you were
to present this to us in person.
● Use the internet if you need it. We all know that even the best developers in the world
spend a good portion of their day searching Google and looking at documentation, so
feel free.
● We kept this exercise unspecific to our brands or internal projects so have fun with it.
Spend as much time on it as you wish. However, it shouldn’t be necessary to spend too much time on it for the purposes of our evaluation. Note in your repository README how long it took you to do this exercise.
Final Note
There are many different kinds of developers, and lots of different specialties. We'll be evaluating your work by looking at code quality, design, readability, functionality, documentation, and decision-making. Do the best you can, but don't get in your head too much. We just want to get to know you as a developer. If you have any questions about this exercise, please feel free to reach out to cdo@esalon.com. Thanks for taking the time to participate in this evaluation exercise.
